EXISTING SYSTEM

Even in the advancement of software compatibility and efficiency the present system of Indian Defense Data Base still works very inefficiently. Even though existing system has nearly all the information that the proposed system asks for, it does not have a centralized access for all this information. The operations on the existing system such as viewing, editing and deleting and so on is very tiring and inefficient.

The data base register contains the name, home phone number, training details etc. These registers can be accessed only by authorized personnel with a certified username and password.

                     The main drawback of this system is that it needs more manual work. Since each separate section has their own respective registers more staff has to be employed to manipulate the registers. Moreover centralized data accessing is very difficult in this system. This is time and money consuming. Editing the registers is a complex task. Lack automation makes the existing system complex and time consuming.
           


PROPOSED SYSTEM

Proposed system aims at removing the drawbacks of existing system. A computerized database management for Indian Defense reduces human labor and save time. It helps the user to view the details of any entries according to the choice given. The viewing and editing of records are very easy through this proposed system. It provides efficient storage. It is closer to real world. The unique user-id and password ensures greater security and prevents unauthorized entry.

      Each entry is efficiently processed and can be viewed by searching by categories. This ensures simple and easy to manage interface. The editing, deleting and modification are done very efficiently in the proposed system. The extensive data gathering ensures that all the information related is securely stored. Moreover the password protection ensures prevention of unauthorized entry and data security. 

The system provides all necessary information about telephone directory software. Proposed system aims at removing the drawbacks of existing system. A computerized Indian Defense Management Software reduces human labor and saves time.
